# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of careful array index management in Java programming to avoid runtime exceptions.
